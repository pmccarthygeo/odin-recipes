        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers rich, savory ingredients to create a comforting, hearty meal. It consists of wide, flat pasta sheets stacked with a variety of fillings. The most traditional version includes a meaty marinara sauce, made with ground beef or pork, seasoned with garlic, onions, and herbs like basil and oregano. Between the layers of pasta, you'll also find creamy ricotta cheese, melted mozzarella, and a generous sprinkle of Parmesan for added richness and flavor.</p>
        <p>The lasagna is typically baked until golden and bubbly, allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully. Its texture contrasts wonderfully between the slightly chewy pasta, the gooey melted cheese, and the savory meat sauce. Variations abound, with some versions featuring vegetables like spinach or mushrooms, or even using a white b√©chamel sauce instead of the tomato-based sauce. Perfect for family gatherings or special occasions, lasagna is a dish that offers both comfort and indulgence in every bite.</p>
